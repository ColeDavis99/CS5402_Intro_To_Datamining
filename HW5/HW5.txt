Q2)

Linear Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 3/5 blue, 78% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 50%
Test Data Comments: Training data had a higher success rate than expected, considering how the 
                    data does not initially appear to be linearly seperable. The testing data 
                    confirms the initial suspicion that the data is not easy to categorize linearly
                    due to the low success rate of 50%.

Poly Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 5/5 blue, 100% accurate 
Testing Data Accuracy: 75%
Test Data Comments: The polynomial SVM is well suited to this shape of dataset where each
                    class of data is bunched together and not intermingled. There was 
                    one outlier (4,5) that appears to be mislabelled as 1 instead of -1.
                    Overall, this is a good (though not the best) model for this dataset.


RBF Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 5/5 blue, 100% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 100%
Test Data Comments: The RBF SVM is the most accurate model that might for both datasets. 
                    Due to the circular "bullseye" shape of the data when graphed spacially,
                    the RBF model is able to accurately mimic the shape of the data and 
                    create classification boundaries with extreme accuracy. I believe this 
                    is the best model to use for this dataset and any future test data.


Sigmoid Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 3/4 green, 3/5 blue, 67% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 50% accurate
Test Data Comments: While the curves produced by the sigmoid model appear similar to the poly SVM,
                    the accuracy is, however, low. I believe with more data the sigmoid model could
                    see an increase in accuracy and produce results similar to the poly model.
