Q2)

Linear Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 3/5 blue, 78% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 50%
Test Data Comments: Training data had a higher success rate than expected, considering how the 
                    data does not initially appear to be linearly seperable. The testing data 
                    confirms the initial suspicion that the data is not easy to categorize linearly
                    due to the low success rate of 50%.

Poly Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 5/5 blue, 100% accurate 
Testing Data Accuracy: 100%
Test Data Comments: The polynomial SVM is well suited to this shape of dataset where each type
                    of data is not intermingled. Both the training and testing datasets achieved an
                    impressive 100% accuracy rate.


RBF Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 4/4 green, 5/5 blue, 100% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 75%
Test Data Comments: The point (2,2) is mislabelled as blue (-1) in my opinion. The data appears
                    to have a slight bulge to the top right and (2,2) should be green (1). Overall,
                    the RBF SVM is an accurate model that might reach a 100% accuracy in test data 
                    if another opinion were to be evaluated.


Sigmoid Testing:
------------------------------------------------
Training Data Accuracy: 3/4 green, 3/5 blue, 67% accurate
Testing Data Accuracy: 50% accurate
Test Data Comments: While the curves produced by the sigmoid model appear similar to the poly SVM,
                    the accuracy is, however, low. I believe with more data the sigmoid model could
                    see an increase in accuracy and produce results similar to the poly model.
